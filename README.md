# PlantEvolution

This is my first foray into the world of evolutionary and genetic algorithms. The goal of this endeavor is to learn more about how genetic algorithms work and how a evolution can be simulated via a computer. This project will be relatively simple one (hopefully) where I will simulate the evolution of the shape of a 2-dimensional plant so that it maximizes its sunlight collection throughout the day.

Note:

In this version of the simulation one of the main flaws is that the plants lack any genetic diversity as they all seem to replicate the most fit plant within a couple generations. I will have to look into a way to combat this

This simulation is also currently run and edited from an ide. I hope to create a menu system that will allow you to change settings inside the program in the future.
